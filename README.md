## Calculating real life distance between 2 humans from 2D images and vidoes

In this project, we calculate real life distance between two human bounding boxes from pixel distance between them. This project was part of my summer internship.<br>
We employ a dynamic scaling factor to convert the pixel distances into real life distances. We propose a model whereby we use both average human height and human width as calibration factor. <br>
